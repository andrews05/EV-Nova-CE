EV Nova Community Edition patch notes

• Registration requirement has been removed.
• Game resolution can be set in the ddraw.ini file. By default it will match your desktop
  resolution.
• Radar interference works again.
• Asteroids will always work regardless of the resolution. No extra plug-ins required.
• Opening a pilot no longer switches to windowed mode temporarily.
• Windows keys are no longer disabled while playing.
• Forced font substitution has been disabled, allowing original Mac fonts such as Geneva to work
  when installed.
• Certain non-ascii characters are now displayed correctly (e.g. in The Frozen Heart plug-in).
• The "Run in a window" setting will immediately switch mode, functioning the same as alt-F.
• Odd width resolutions are now semi-supported (by leaving a blank column on the right edge).
• Dialogs are no longer forced to even dimensions. This prevents scaling the background image
  unnecessarily, resolving a performance issue on Apple Silicon.
• Additional keyboard shortcuts from Mac Nova 1.1 have been added:
    - Spacebar to open (and close) ship info in the shipyard
    - B to show/hide borders in the map
    - C to clear route in the map (previously centered map, but Spacebar still does this)
• Experimental UI scaling can be set in the ddraw.ini file.
