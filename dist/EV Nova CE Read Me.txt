EV Nova Community Edition r3


Patch Notes

• Registration requirement has been removed.
• Game resolution can be set in the ddraw.ini file. By default it will match your desktop
  resolution.
• Experimental UI scaling can be set in the ddraw.ini file.
• Radar interference works again and also supports lower depth ppats as used in the.
• Asteroids will always work regardless of the resolution. No extra plug-ins required.
• Opening a pilot no longer switches to windowed mode temporarily.
• Windows keys are no longer disabled while playing.
• Forced font substitution has been disabled, allowing original Mac fonts such as Geneva and
  Charcoal to work when installed.
• Certain non-ascii characters are now displayed correctly (e.g. in The Frozen Heart plug-in).
• The "Run in a window" setting will immediately switch mode, functioning the same as alt-F.
• Odd width resolutions are now semi-supported (by leaving a blank column on the right edge).
• Dialogs are no longer forced to even dimensions. This prevents scaling the background image
  unnecessarily, resolving a performance issue on Apple Silicon.
• Mission title in the BBS no longer renders poorly when running in Wine.
• Particle cap has been increased from 1,024 to 100,000.
• Additional keyboard shortcuts from Mac Nova 1.1 have been added:
    - Spacebar to open (and close) ship info in the shipyard
    - B to show/hide borders in the map
    - C to clear route in the map (previously centered map, but Spacebar still does this)
• The app path is written to the registry, allowing scripts etc to locate the exe.
• The game will look for its Files, Plug-ins & Pilots in the "current directory", which may be set
  to a location other than the EV Nova folder to facilitate running total conversions. The following
  are some possible ways of doing this (you only need to do one of these):
    - Copy the "TC Launcher.vbs" script file to the TC's folder. Double-click to run.
    - Create a shortcut to EV Nova.exe, get properties and set "Start in" to the path to the TC.
• Hyperspace Effects preference is now visible and will disable the white flash when turned off.
• Pilot files are no longer encrypted.
• Debug mode can be enabled by pressing Alt+Home (see details below).


Debug Mode Effects

• Show ids/raw values in various dialogs
• Always have afterburner
• 50x faster armor regen
• Ignore capture odds (for both player and AI)
